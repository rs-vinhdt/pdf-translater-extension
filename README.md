3.  **Configure API Settings:**
    * **AI Provider:** Select your desired AI service (e.g., "Google Gemini" or "OpenAI GPT") from the dropdown.
    * **API Key:** Enter your valid API Key for the selected provider. This is crucial for the extension to work.
        * **For Google Gemini:** Obtain your API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
        * **For OpenAI GPT:** Obtain your API key from the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

    * **AI Model:** Choose a specific AI model from the dropdown. The available models will update based on your selected AI Provider.
    * **Custom Prompt:** (Optional) Customize the prompt sent to the AI model. Use `{text}` as a placeholder for the selected text that will be translated.
        * *Example:* `Translate this scientific text into simplified Chinese: '{text}'`
        * Click "Reset to Default" to revert to the standard translation prompt.
